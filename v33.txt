When writing the user_query for Utilization 1, explain in plain English that the model should first select calls using the L1/L2 anchor, then separately select calls not matching the L1/L2 anchor but containing the search phrases in transcript or summary, and finally combine both groups to count distinct calls. Describe this as sequential steps in natural language — do not use SQL keywords like SELECT, WHERE, or UNION — so the model generates a single total count instead of multiple rows.
