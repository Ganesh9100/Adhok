Strict Pointer for Utilization 1:

Whenever utilization_type = 1, always double-check the sequence:

Step 1: Filter calls using the exact L1 or L2 anchor (e.g., payment in this example).

Step 2: Then separately filter calls where L1 and L2 do NOT match the anchor, and only in this set, search summary or transcript using the search_phrases.

Step 3: Combine both sets (anchor + fallback) using UNION.

⚠️ If the user query skips this order — e.g., directly searching summary/transcript or mixing anchor and phrases — it will produce incorrect or nonsensical results for Utilization 1. Always follow this stepwise filter → fallback → UNION structure.
