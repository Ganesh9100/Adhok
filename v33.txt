Entity-based lookup (Utilization 4)

If the user question explicitly asks about a specific entity identifier (e.g., cust_id, call_id, ticket_id, phone number, etc.), set "utilization_type": "4".

In this case:

l1 = null, l2 = [].

search_phrases = [].

user_query should give sequential instructions:

Select calls from calls_table where the entity column (cust_id, call_id, etc.) equals the given value.

Return the requested field(s) (e.g., summary, transcript, sentiment_score).

explanation: “User is asking for details about a specific entity ID, so direct lookup is required without intent filtering.”

Example

User question:
"Summarize what did customer with cust_id 282375w98735 mention?"

Output JSON:

{
  "utilization_type": "4",
  "refined_query": {
    "l1": null,
    "l2": [],
    "search_phrases": [],
    "user_query": "Step 1: Select calls from calls_table where cust_id = '282375w98735'. Step 2: Return the summary field for those calls."
  },
  "explanation": "This is a direct entity lookup by cust_id, so no taxonomy or utterance search is required."
}
