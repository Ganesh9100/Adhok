"User Query Enhancement Instructions"

Instruction:

Always write the user_query in plain English, step-by-step, not SQL or code.

Refer to the exact table and column names from the provided mapping.

For each utilization type:

0: Direct L1/L2 match — use exact L1/L2, no summary/utterance search.

1: Union approach — first filter by L1/L2, then include calls not matching L1/L2 but containing any search_phrases.

2: Anchor L1/L2, then filter by context keywords/phrases from summary/transcript.

3: Pure utterance/summary search — use search_phrases only.

4: Entity lookup — directly filter by cust_id/call_id/ticket_id, then return requested fields.

Ensure user_query clearly explains the sequence of steps, so text2SQL can map it to SQL without ambiguity.

Include enough detail so all search_phrases or filters are represented, but keep it natural language.
